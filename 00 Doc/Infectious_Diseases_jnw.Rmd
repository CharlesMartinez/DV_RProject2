For this project, we found a set of data that listed cases of different infectious dieases in various counties in California. It included how many males and females were infected per year, as well as the total number of infections per county per year. Here is a summary of our data:

```{r}
source("../01 Data/Infectious_Diseases.R")
summary(df)
```

### First plot:

For the first plot, this is what the call to the Oracle database looked like:
```
df_jnw <- data.frame(fromJSON(getURL(URLencode('129.152.144.84:5001/rest/native/?query="select * from Infectious_Diseases where SEX = \'Female\' or SEX = \'Male\'"'),httpheader=c(DB='jdbc:oracle:thin:@129.152.144.84:1521/PDBF15DV.usuniversi01134.oraclecloud.internal', USER='cs329e_jnw653', PASS='orcl_jnw653', MODE='native_mode', MODEL='model', returnDimensions = 'False', returnFor = 'JSON'), verbose = TRUE), ))
```
Note that only the 'Male' and 'Female' sexes were included, and not 'Total'.

And this is the code that was used to generate the first plot:
```
df_jnw %>% select(DISEASE, YEAR, COUNT, SEX) %>% filter(DISEASE == "Gonorrhea" | DISEASE == "Chlamydia" | DISEASE == "HIV") %>% ggplot(aes(x = YEAR, y = COUNT, color = DISEASE)) + geom_point(position = "jitter") + facet_wrap(~SEX) + theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=70, size = 10, vjust=0.5))
```
